React Responsive, Fullstack, Ecommerce App . I have used React, Material UI, Stripe, Formik, Yup, Strapi, and Redux Toolkit to build this entire application. This application will allow you to filter and add products into a cart, have a form to fill out information and make payments through Stripe with a backend api supported by Strapi.

Attached are a few screenshots of the App:
